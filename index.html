                        I study plant adaptation to changing environments,
                        with a specific focus on mixed mating systems.<br />
                        The seemingly simple task of determining mating
                        patterns in plants is rendered complex by the
                        environment-dependent variation inherent to most
                        plant mating systems, the dependence of plants on
                        pollen vectors and vice-versa (especially
                        animal-pollinated plants), and the feedback between
                        mating strategies, genetic diversity, and
                        populations dynamics. Moreover, anthropogenic
                        environmental modifications present a new challenge
                        for present-day taxa to rapidly adapt to selective
                        pressures occurring at higher intensity, larger
                        spatial scales, and faster pace than ever before.

                    <p>
                        To understand these complex eco-evolutionary
                        dynamics between plants, biotic and abiotic
                        environmental variation including anthropogenic
                        ones, and intra- and inter-specific interactions, I
                        use a variety of tools and methods. I combine
                        fieldwork, common garden, and transplant
                        experiments, with quantitative genetics, population
                        genetics, and genomic tools, ecological epigenetics,
                        and landscape ecology.

                        As a postdoc, I have worked in research teams of
                        various sizes and with different levels of
                        responsibility, ranging from data analyses and
                        publication (2016-2017) to the design and execution
                        of entire experimental studies (2013-2017). Beyond
                        plant mating systems, I have also worked on projects
                        investigating population genetics of invasive
                        species, plant adaptation to climate change thought
                        adaptive differentiation in traits and their
                        plasticity, conservation genetics of endemic
                        species, and contributed to de novo genome assembly
                        in tripanosomatids. Whenever possible, my work
                        covers data and samples gathered from broad
                        geographic ranges, which allows to infer general
                        patterns about species parallel evolution, or to
                        compare environmental factors that result in
                        divergence along environmental clines.
