                    I study plant adaptation to changing environments, with a specific
                    focus on mixed mating systems. The seemingly simple task of
                    determining mating patterns in plants is rendered complex by the
                    environment-dependent variation inherent to most plant mating
                    systems, the dependence of plants on pollen vectors and vice-versa
                    (especially animal-pollinated plants), and the feedback between
                    mating strategies, genetic diversity, and populations dynamics.
                    Moreover, anthropogenic environmental modifications present a new
                    challenge for present-day taxa to rapidly adapt to selective
                    pressures occurring at higher intensity, larger spatial scales, and
                    faster pace than ever before. To understand these complex
                    eco-evolutionary dynamics between plants, biotic and abiotic
                    environmental variation including anthropogenic ones, and intra- and
                    inter-specific interactions, I use a variety of tools and methods. I
                    combine fieldwork, common garden, and transplant experiments, with
                    quantitative genetics, population genetics, and genomic tools,
                    ecological epigenetics, and landscape ecology.

                    As a postdoc, I have worked in research teams of various sizes and
                    with different levels of responsibility, ranging from data analyses
                    and publication (2016-2017) to the design and execution of entire
                    experimental studies (2013-2017). Beyond plant mating systems, I
                    have also worked on projects investigating population genetics of
                    invasive species, plant adaptation to climate change thought
                    adaptive differentiation in traits and their plasticity,
                    conservation genetics of endemic species, and contributed to de novo
                    genome assembly in tripanosomatids. Whenever possible, my work
                    covers data and samples gathered from broad geographic ranges, which
                    allows to infer general patterns about species parallel evolution,
                    or to compare environmental factors that result in divergence along
                    environmental clines.

                    In 2018 I started developing my own research projects and currently
                    have three research axes:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The study of adaptive plastic cleistogamy as a unique model for
                        mixed mating
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Using the resurrection method for the study of rapid plant
                        adaptation to climate change and pollinator decline
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Plant adaptation to pollinator variation in urban environments
                    </li>
                </ul>
