    Minuartia smejkalii is an edaphic perennial plant endemic to the Czech
    Republic. The species’ already restricted habitat to serpentine soils in two
    natural reserves south of Prague was further fragmented and degraded by
    anthropogenic actions since the 1960s. The LIFE for Minuartia project’s main
    goal was to reinforce extant and restore extinct populations of M. smejkalii
    via habitat restoration, population demographic and genetic reinforcement
    from appropriate in situ and ex situ cultivated materials.

    I was in charge of the conservation genetics aspect of LIFE for Minuartia
    which included
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      assessing genetic variation and its distribution estimated from anonymous
      RADSeq markers among populations, regions, as well as among all Minuartia
      species present in the Czech Republic.
    </li>
    <li>
      study the occurrence of inbreeding depression, outbreeding depression and
      heterosis by comparing the fitness of inbred and outbred offspring
      produced from controlled pollinations and cultivated under different
      conditions.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The results showed that M. smejkalii is genetically differentiated from
    other Minuartia taxa present in the Czech Republic.

      only two extant locations of the species (Zelivka and Hrnicre), and the
      other two Minuartia species known to the Czech Republic (M. concortica and
      M. caespitosa)

      Figure 2. Estimates of inbreeding depression (in orange) and outbreeding
      depression (in blue) for three populations of Minuartia smejkalii. Note
      the inversed y-axis. Large absolute values mean large inbreeding
      depression or heterosis, regardless of the sign. Inbreeding depression in
      particularly high in population Z6, which is an order of magnitude smaller
      than populations Z1 and Z2.

    Moreover, intrapopulation genetic variation was high and inter-region
    variation was low, which could suggest gene flow between regions, or, more
    plausibly, a genetic lag due to the longevity of the species. Although the
    estimates varied between traits and environments, I detected high inbreeding
    depression in large populations, high heterosis in small populations, and
    low to no outbreeding depression. Altogether, these results offer an
    optimistic perspective for the conservation of the species which still
    presents significant genetic diversity and heterosis that can be used to
    introduce genotypes that will increase the adaptive potential of extant
    populations with minimal risk of breaking down adaptive complexes.
