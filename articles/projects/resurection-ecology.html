        Rapid evolution of selfing syndrome in plants studied with resurrection
        ecology
    </h3>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
        The resurrection method is a new ecological approach for the study of rapid
        adaptation in natural populations. A basic resurrection study is a common
        garden experiment where ancestral genotypes (preserved as seeds in natural
        seed banks or seed repositories) are grown side-by-side with their
        descendant genotypes (sampled in the same site at present). This setting
        allows for instant comparison between ancestral and descendant genotypes. If
        phenotypic trait shifts are detected between ancestors and descendants, they
        can be interpreted as the outcome of rapid evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
        The resurrection method opens the possibility for the study of rapid
        evolution in arable weeds, which are exposed to new, intense selective
        pressures with the development of modern agriculture and global change. In
        particular, pollinator decline, coupled with phenological mismatches in
        flowering time due to temperature fluctuations, could lead towards increased
        self-pollination and a decreased attractivity of plants to pollinators
        (selfing syndrome). Alternatively, arable weeds could evolve towards
        increasing their attractivity to pollinators, thus maintaining pollinator
        interactions despite the reduction in pollination services. Empirical
        observation of contemporary evolution in arable weeds has produced data in
        line with both hypotheses, and it is likely that the direction of trait
        changes is species- and even population-specific.

    <p>
        I used the resurrection method with two self-compatible, insect-pollinated,
        annual, arable weeds (Matthiola tricuspidata and Centaurium erythraea) to
        investigate the effects of climate change and pollinator decline on the
        evolution of their reproductive and pollination strategies. An innovative
        aspect I implemented is the upgrade of the basic resurrection common garden
        with other approaches from evolutionary ecology – reciprocal transplant in
        simulated environments, genomic tools, and ecological epigenetics.

            While common garden resurrection experiments can tell us about phenotypic
            trait shifts between ancestors and descendants, they cannot directly test
            whether these shifts are adaptive. I tested the adaptive character of
            observed phenotypic shifts between ancestors and descendants in the
            Mediterranean annual, Matthiola tricuspidata, using reciprocal
            “transplants in time”. To do this, ancestral and descendant genotypes of
            one natural population were grown in simulated past and present-day
            environmental conditions in regulated growth chambers. Past conditions
            were characterized by lower temperature, higher precipitation levels and
            humidity compared to present-day conditions. In both experimental
            environments, ancestral and descendant genotypes were significantly
            different from one another. In both growth chambers, descendants flowered
            earlier (consistent with adaptation to warmer springs, Figure 1 top), had
            larger daily floral displays (consistent with adaptation to maintain
            pollinator interactions via increase attractivity, Figure 1 middle). Plant
            size was measured as a fitness proxy, showing overall larger plants in the
            present-day, warmer and drier environment. Ancestors were larger than
            descendants in the past environment, but no significant differences
            between ancestors and descendants, suggesting that both ancestral and
            descendant genotypes are capable of increasing their vegetative growth in
            warmer and drier environments (Figure 1 bottom).

            Ancestral and descendant seeds from two natural populations of C.
            erythraea – one from Belgium (ancestors and descendants sampled 24 years
            apart) and one from Poland (sampled 17 years apart) were grown in a common
            garden, and phenotypic and genetic diversity was compared to disentangle
            the effects of random from those of selective evolution.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        In both populations, the descendants had larger daily floral displays
        (Figure 2) and larger petals (Figure 3), whereas the anther-stigma distance
        remained unchanged (Figure 4). Altogether, the observations show an
        evolution to increased flower attractiveness that could maintain
        plant-pollinator interactions.

            Pairwise Fst estimates showed low differentiation between ancestors and
            descendants in Belgium (0.077), and high differentiation in Poland
            (0.292). This suggests the occurrence of major evolutionary or demographic
            changes in the Polish population since the sampling of ancestral genotypes
            (e.g. migration, extinction and recolonization) or possible high sampling
            bias in the past. This result illustrates a shortcoming of resurrection
            studies that is often acknowledged but rarely accounted for – with only
            two temporal points in a single population, it is difficult to disentangle
            the effects of natural selection from stochastic variation in allelic
            frequencies due to random evolutionary processes or sampling bias. As
            returning in the past to resample the population is not an option, testing
            for different evolutionary scenarios using approximate Bayesian
            computations (ABC) could bring insight into the population evolutionary
            history. This nevertheless requires genotyping neighboring populations to
            be able to infer the probability that Poland the sampled descendant
            genotypes are direct offspring of the genotypes present in 2003, or were
            introduced from another population in its vicinity.

        Disentangling genetic from hereditary epigenetic variation in the rapid
        adaptation of Centaurium erythrae. Combining the resurrection method with
        ecological epigenetics
    </h4>
    <p>
        This ongoing pilot introduces ecological epigenetics within the existing
        framework of resurrection ecology, for a novel approach of the study of
        rapid plant adaptation to global change and pollinator decline via
        transgenerational plasticity. Indeed, it has been shown that
        transgenerational plasticity can persist in plants for multiple generations,
        mediated via hereditary epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation.
    </p>
    <p>
        To test for potential effects of transgenerational plasticity mediated by
        hereditary epigenetic variation, I cultivated F1 descendants of the same two
        populations of C. erythraea as above in a common garden. Half of the plants
        were subjected to a demethylation treatment by spraying a solution of
        5-azacitidine, which should indiscriminately reduce methylation levels in
        all treated plants. If phenotypic trait shifts are due to hereditary
        epigenetic differences, I expect the phenotypic differences between
        ancestors and descendants to be reduced or even cancelled out in the
        demethylation compared to the control treatment. If the differences between
        ancestors and descendants are mainly governed by genetic variation, then the
        demethylation treatment should not have an effect on the overall differences
        between ancestors and descendants (Figure 5). The study will investigate
        shifts in life history traits for the entire lifecycle of C. eythraea from
        juvenile growth rates, through leaf economic spectra, flowering phenology,
        to plant attractivity and fitness.
