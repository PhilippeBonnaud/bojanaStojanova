  <p>
    Heterostylous plants such as Primula veris have two floral morphs with
    different and reciprocate positions of the anther and stigma, which
    facilitate pollen transfer between morphs, and hinder it within morphs, thus
    favoring cross-pollination. Cross-pollination is further favored by morph
    self-incompatibility. In a population at equilibrium, isoplethy (equal
    frequencies of each morph) is expected, because it maximises average fitness
    in the population. Disturbance events, such as population fragmentation
    which can cause stochastic morph frequency variation and thus limit the
    availability for suitable mating partners in a population. Coupled with
    effects of climate change that affect plants and pollinators alike,
    deviations from isoplethy may thus impose an increased threat to plants with
    complex mating systems, such as heterostyly.

    The citizen science campaign Looking for Cowslips gathered data about the
    distribution of floral morphs in P. veris. Between 2021 and 2022, the
    campaign gathered data on over 8000 locations across Europe thanks to the
    contribution of local campaign managers coordinated by the research team of
    T. Aavik at the University of Tartu, Estonia. The results expectedly showed
    that deviation from isoplethy is more pronounced in smaller populations that
    are more susceptible to genetic drift. Surprisingly, the direction of the
    deviation was not random, and populations with excess of the short-styled
    morph prevailed across Europe. The deviation in favor of the short-styled
    morph was more pronounced closer to urban areas, and in populations with
    higher precipitation. These results open the question about possible fitness
    advantage of the short styled morph that would favor its distribution, but
    also about the relationship between P. veris and its pollinators, especially
    in the context of climate change that would modify precipitation patterns.

    I was involved in the campaign as National Coordinator for North Macedonia.
    All national coordinators were given a starting communication package with
    social media posts, graphics, and press releases that they could distribute
    through their own networks, and were offered monthly group consultations
    with the PR expert of the campaign. The local implementation of the campaign
    was left at their discretion.

      As a national coordinator, I integrated the Looking for Cowslips campaign
      in the Science for Children education platform. This resulted in a twofold
      benefit – recruitment of participants was facilitated by reaching out to
      the followers of the Science for Children platform, and on the other hand,
      Looking for Cowslips provided educational material (1, 2, 3, 4) about
      plant reproduction and biodiversity conservation for Science for Children.
      The 2022 campaign had an even broader span of activities, organized in the
      scope of the “Spring of cowslips” event. The outcome of this huge
      communication and education effort was visible in the results of the
      campaign – North Macedonia, being one of the smallest European countries
      with a population of 2 million, was among the top 10 contributors of the
      campaign (Figure 1).
