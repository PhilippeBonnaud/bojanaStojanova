    Weedy parasites invade crops often with dire consequences for yield. The
    devastating effects of weedy parasites are aided by modern agriculture,
    notably the reduced genetic resources of monoculture crop resistance which
    are regularly circumvented by the parasite, and the inability to
    discriminate between crops and weedy parasites for mass eradications.
    Phelipanche ramosa is a weedy parasite with a broad geographic distribution
    that attacks a diverse range of dicotyledonous crops. The species has been
    documented to regularly invade new crops, and quickly overcome defense
    mechanisms of resistant crop varieties. As a postdoc, I investigated the
    distribution of genetic diversity and host preference of P. ramosa across
    the Mediterranean basin with the goal to understand its evolutionary history
    and identify factors that lead to the emergence of new host races in western
    France.

    To assess the distribution of different genotypes along geographic and host
    plant gradients of P. ramosa I genotyped over 100 populations of P. ramosa
    harvested on various crops using SSR markers. I then tested host preference
    in rhizotrons for a representative core collection of 15 populations. I
    identified three highly homozygous genetic groups with distinct host
    preferences and life cycles. Type 1 had restricted distribution in western
    France and adapted to canola as host by extending its life cycle, so it
    matches the winter annual cycle of canola. This is the most recently emerged
    host race, coinciding with the introduction of canola cultures in western
    France in the 1980s. Type 2a was found mostly in eastern France, with
    preference for hemp as main host. Type 2b had a broad distribution, with
    overall good performance on all hosts, but some preference for hosts of the
    Solanaceae family.
