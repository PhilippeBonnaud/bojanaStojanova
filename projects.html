            Rapid evolution of selfing syndrome in plants studied with
            resurrection ecology
          </h3>

          <h4 class="font-p-title">Overview</h4>

          <p>
            The resurrection method is a new ecological approach for the study
            of rapid adaptation in natural populations. A basic resurrection
            study is a common garden experiment where ancestral genotypes
            (preserved as seeds in natural seed banks or seed repositories) are
            grown side-by-side with their descendant genotypes (sampled in the
            same site at present). This setting allows for instant comparison
            between ancestral and descendant genotypes. If phenotypic trait
            shifts are detected between ancestors and descendants, they can be
            interpreted as the outcome of rapid evolution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The resurrection method opens the possibility for the study of rapid
            evolution in arable weeds, which are exposed to new, intense
            selective pressures with the development of modern agriculture and
            global change. In particular, pollinator decline, coupled with
            phenological mismatches in flowering time due to temperature
            fluctuations, could lead towards increased self-pollination and a
            decreased attractivity of plants to pollinators (selfing syndrome).
            Alternatively, arable weeds could evolve towards increasing their
            attractivity to pollinators, thus maintaining pollinator
            interactions despite the reduction in pollination services.
            Empirical observation of contemporary evolution in arable weeds has
            produced data in line with both hypotheses, and it is likely that
            the direction of trait changes is species- and even
            population-specific.
          </p>
          <p>
            I used the resurrection method with two self-compatible,
            insect-pollinated, annual, arable weeds (Matthiola tricuspidata and
            Centaurium erythraea) to investigate the effects of climate change
            and pollinator decline on the evolution of their reproductive and
            pollination strategies. An innovative aspect I implemented is the
            upgrade of the basic resurrection common garden with other
            approaches from evolutionary ecology – reciprocal transplant in
            simulated environments, genomic tools, and ecological epigenetics.

            <p>
              While common garden resurrection experiments can tell us about
              phenotypic trait shifts between ancestors and descendants, they
              cannot directly test whether these shifts are adaptive. I tested
              the adaptive character of observed phenotypic shifts between
              ancestors and descendants in the Mediterranean annual, Matthiola
              tricuspidata, using reciprocal “transplants in time”. To do this,
              ancestral and descendant genotypes of one natural population were
              grown in simulated past and present-day environmental conditions
              in regulated growth chambers. Past conditions were characterized
              by lower temperature, higher precipitation levels and humidity
              compared to present-day conditions. In both experimental
              environments, ancestral and descendant genotypes were
              significantly different from one another. In both growth chambers,
              descendants flowered earlier (consistent with adaptation to warmer
              springs, Figure 1 top), had larger daily floral displays
              (consistent with adaptation to maintain pollinator interactions
              via increase attractivity, Figure 1 middle). Plant size was
              measured as a fitness proxy, showing overall larger plants in the
              present-day, warmer and drier environment. Ancestors were larger
              than descendants in the past environment, but no significant
              differences between ancestors and descendants, suggesting that
              both ancestral and descendant genotypes are capable of increasing
              their vegetative growth in warmer and drier environments (Figure 1
              bottom).

              Pairwise Fst estimates showed low differentiation between
              ancestors and descendants in Belgium (0.077), and high
              differentiation in Poland (0.292). This suggests the occurrence of
              major evolutionary or demographic changes in the Polish population
              since the sampling of ancestral genotypes (e.g. migration,
              extinction and recolonization) or possible high sampling bias in
              the past. This result illustrates a shortcoming of resurrection
              studies that is often acknowledged but rarely accounted for – with
              only two temporal points in a single population, it is difficult
              to disentangle the effects of natural selection from stochastic
              variation in allelic frequencies due to random evolutionary
              processes or sampling bias. As returning in the past to resample
              the population is not an option, testing for different
              evolutionary scenarios using approximate Bayesian computations
              (ABC) could bring insight into the population evolutionary
              history. This nevertheless requires genotyping neighboring
              populations to be able to infer the probability that Poland the
              sampled descendant genotypes are direct offspring of the genotypes
              present in 2003, or were introduced from another population in its
              vicinity.

            Disentangling genetic from hereditary epigenetic variation in the
            rapid adaptation of Centaurium erythrae. Combining the resurrection
            method with ecological epigenetics
          </h4>
          <p>
            This ongoing pilot introduces ecological epigenetics within the
            existing framework of resurrection ecology, for a novel approach of
            the study of rapid plant adaptation to global change and pollinator
            decline via transgenerational plasticity. Indeed, it has been shown
            that transgenerational plasticity can persist in plants for multiple
            generations, mediated via hereditary epigenetic modifications such
            as DNA methylation.
          </p>
          <p>
            To test for potential effects of transgenerational plasticity
            mediated by hereditary epigenetic variation, I cultivated F1
            descendants of the same two populations of C. erythraea as above in
            a common garden. Half of the plants were subjected to a
            demethylation treatment by spraying a solution of 5-azacitidine,
            which should indiscriminately reduce methylation levels in all
            treated plants. If phenotypic trait shifts are due to hereditary
            epigenetic differences, I expect the phenotypic differences between
            ancestors and descendants to be reduced or even cancelled out in the
            demethylation compared to the control treatment. If the differences
            between ancestors and descendants are mainly governed by genetic
            variation, then the demethylation treatment should not have an
            effect on the overall differences between ancestors and descendants
            (Figure 5). The study will investigate shifts in life history traits
            for the entire lifecycle of C. eythraea from juvenile growth rates,
            through leaf economic spectra, flowering phenology, to plant
            attractivity and fitness.

            <em>Minuartia smejkalii</em> is an edaphic perennial plant endemic
            to the Czech Republic. The species’ already restricted habitat to
            serpentine soils in two natural reserves south of Prague was further
            fragmented and degraded by anthropogenic actions since the 1960s.
            The LIFE for Minuartia project’s main goal was to reinforce extant
            and restore extinct populations of M. smejkalii via habitat
            restoration, population demographic and genetic reinforcement from
            appropriate in situ and ex situ cultivated materials.

              Moreover, intrapopulation genetic variation was high and

              between regions, or, more plausibly, a genetic lag due to the
              longevity of the species. Although the estimates varied between
              traits and environments, I detected high inbreeding depression in
              large populations, high heterosis in small populations, and low to
              no outbreeding depression. Altogether, these results offer an
              optimistic perspective for the conservation of the species which
              still presents significant genetic diversity and heterosis that
              can be used to introduce genotypes that will increase the adaptive
              potential of extant populations with minimal risk of breaking down

            The devastating effects of weedy parasites are aided by modern
            agriculture, notably the reduced genetic resources of monoculture
            crop resistance which are regularly circumvented by the parasite,
            and the inability to discriminate between crops and weedy parasites
            for mass eradications. Phelipanche ramosa is a weedy parasite with a
            broad geographic distribution that attacks a diverse range of
            dicotyledonous crops. The species has been documented to regularly
            invade new crops, and quickly overcome defense mechanisms of
            resistant crop varieties. As a postdoc, I investigated the
            distribution of genetic diversity and host preference of P. ramosa
            across the Mediterranean basin with the goal to understand its
            evolutionary history and identify factors that lead to the emergence
            of new host races in western France.

          <p>
            To assess the distribution of different genotypes along geographic
            and host plant gradients of P. ramosa I genotyped over 100
            populations of P. ramosa harvested on various crops using SSR
            markers. I then tested host preference in rhizotrons for a
            representative core collection of 15 populations. I identified three
            highly homozygous genetic groups with distinct host preferences and
            life cycles. Type 1 had restricted distribution in western France
            and adapted to canola as host by extending its life cycle, so it
            matches the winter annual cycle of canola. This is the most recently
            emerged host race, coinciding with the introduction of canola
            cultures in western France in the 1980s. Type 2a was found mostly in
            eastern France, with preference for hemp as main host. Type 2b had a
            broad distribution, with overall good performance on all hosts, but
            some preference for hosts of the Solanaceae family.

            Heterostylous plants such as Primula veris have two floral morphs
            with different and reciprocate positions of the anther and stigma,
            which facilitate pollen transfer between morphs, and hinder it
            within morphs, thus favoring cross-pollination. Cross-pollination is
            further favored by morph self-incompatibility. In a population at
            equilibrium, isoplethy (equal frequencies of each morph) is
            expected, because it maximises average fitness in the population.
            Disturbance events, such as population fragmentation which can cause
            stochastic morph frequency variation and thus limit the availability
            for suitable mating partners in a population. Coupled with effects
            of climate change that affect plants and pollinators alike,
            deviations from isoplethy may thus impose an increased threat to
            plants with complex mating systems, such as heterostyly.

            The citizen science campaign Looking for Cowslips gathered data
            about the distribution of floral morphs in P. veris. Between 2021
            and 2022, the campaign gathered data on over 8000 locations across
            Europe thanks to the contribution of local campaign managers
            coordinated by the research team of T. Aavik at the University of
            Tartu, Estonia. The results expectedly showed that deviation from
            isoplethy is more pronounced in smaller populations that are more
            susceptible to genetic drift. Surprisingly, the direction of the
            deviation was not random, and populations with excess of the
            short-styled morph prevailed across Europe. The deviation in favor
            of the short-styled morph was more pronounced closer to urban areas,
            and in populations with higher precipitation. These results open the
            question about possible fitness advantage of the short styled morph
            that would favor its distribution, but also about the relationship
            between P. veris and its pollinators, especially in the context of
            climate change that would modify precipitation patterns.

            I was involved in the campaign as National Coordinator for North
            Macedonia. All national coordinators were given a starting
            communication package with social media posts, graphics, and press
            releases that they could distribute through their own networks, and
            were offered monthly group consultations with the PR expert of the
            campaign. The local implementation of the campaign was left at their
            discretion.

              As a national coordinator, I integrated the Looking for Cowslips
              campaign in the Science for Children education platform. This
              resulted in a twofold benefit – recruitment of participants was
              facilitated by reaching out to the followers of the Science for
              Children platform, and on the other hand, Looking for Cowslips
              provided educational material (1, 2, 3, 4) about plant
              reproduction and biodiversity conservation for Science for
              Children. The 2022 campaign had an even broader span of
              activities, organized in the scope of the “Spring of cowslips”
              event. The outcome of this huge communication and education effort
              was visible in the results of the campaign – North Macedonia,
              being one of the smallest European countries with a population of
              2 million, was among the top 10 contributors of the campaign
              (Figure 1).
